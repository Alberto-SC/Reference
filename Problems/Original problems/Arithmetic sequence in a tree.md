A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least two elements, and the difference between every two consecutive elements is the same. More formally, a sequence s is arithmetic if and only if s[i+1] - s[i] == s[1] - s[0] for all valid i.

You are given a tree in wich there are some numbers 

Return a list of boolean elements answer, where answer[i] is true if the array formed with the numbers in the path from root to i 
 can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence, and false otherwise. ans[0] must be true;
